# HEST Radiomics Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **HEST-Radiomics**, a radiomics-based handcrafted feature extraction pipeline for spatial transcriptomics and whole-slide imaging (WSI) analysis.

This documentation describes the basic usage of the HEST radiomics pipeline.

<!-- The project provides:

- HEST dataset handling utilities
- Patch-level radiomics extraction
- Cell-aware segmentation processing
- Spatial transcriptomics integration
- HDF5 / H5AD-based workflows
- Multi-processing extraction pipelines -->

## Main Features

### Patch-Level Radiomics

Extract handcrafted radiomics features from spatial transcriptomics patches using PyRadiomics.

### Cell-Aware Segmentation

Polygon-based cell segmentation storage with rasterized mask generation during runtime.

### HEST Dataset Integration

Built-in utilities for loading and processing HEST spatial transcriptomics datasets.

### Spatial Transcriptomics Support

Compatible with H5AD-based transcriptomics workflows and Visium-style datasets.

### Efficient Storage

Compact polygon-based HDF5 segmentation representation for large-scale WSI processing.
